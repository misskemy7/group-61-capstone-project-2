## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://misskemy7.github.io/group-61-capstone-project-2/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### Continued development

We discovered we had some challenges with the responsive design so we would need to work on that collectively. Also, we didn't use any CSS framework which is something else we would need to look into

### Useful resources

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
This was shared by a group member which helped with the CSS aspect.
